This repository contains my CA assignment for the Algorithm & Design & Problem Solving module in the first year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

## Overview
I developed a system to manage data for a pharmaceutical companyâ€™s three production lines. My tasks included:

1. **Data Merge and Sort**: Combined team lists and sorted them by surname using an optimized merge sort, enhanced by an elementary sort.
   
2. **Cross-Certification Check**: Created a routine to list employees certified for all three lines.

3. **Employee Search**: Implemented a search function to locate employees by surname.

### Deliverables
- Data structures with test data for teams and certifications
- Flowchart for sorting
- Pseudo-code for cross-certification and search functions
- C code demonstrating the tasks

**Grade Received: 98%**
